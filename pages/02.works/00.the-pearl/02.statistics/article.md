**ZONING CALCULATIONS:** 

OCCUPANCY: J-2 

MIN LOT WIDTH 18’ 

EXISTING LOT WIDTH 35.17’ 

MIN LOT AREA (ZR23-32) 1700 SF 

EXISTING LOT AREA 

33.17’ X 99.92’ = 3,514.2 SF 

MIN OPEN SPACE 17.5% 

MAX LOT COVERAGE (ZR23-145) 65% 

3,514 X 65% = 2,284 SF 

PROPOSED LOT COVERAGE 65% 

2,275 SF OK 

MAX FAR: 3.44 (4 .0 Quality Housing) 

4 X 3,514.2 = 14,056.75 SF 

FLOOR AREA PROPOSED 13,987 SF 

MAX BLDG. HEIGHT 80 FT 

PROP. BLDG HT 75 FT 

REAR YARD REQUIRED (ZR23-145) 30’-0” 

REAR YARD PROPOSED 30’

**FLOOR AREA CALCULATIONS:**

1ST – 4TH FLOORS 9,100 SF

5TH – 6TH FLOORS 4,170 SF

7TH – 8TH FLOORS 3,150 SF

**TOTAL F.A. 16,420 SF**

**MECHANICAL / CHASE DEDUCTION**

1ST FLOOR 36.2 SF

2ND – 4TH FLOORS 145 SF

5TH & 6TH FLOORS 91 SF

7TH & 8TH FLOORS 73.4 SF

**TOTAL 345 SF**

 

**QUALITY HOUSING:**

LAUNDRY ROOM 100 SF

RECREATION ROOM 463.78 SF

Q.H. LOW DENSITY CORRIDOS (L&A)

1ST FLOOR 723+ SF

2ND – 6TH FLOORS 393+ SF

7TH & 8TH FLOORS 312+ SF

SUBTOTAL 1,428 SF

REFUSE AREA 12X8 = 96 SF

**TOTAL 2,087 SF**

 

**B + C = TOTAL DEDUCTIONS**

** **

**345 SF + 1,987 SF = 2,432.8 SF**

** **

**16,420 SF – 2,432.8 SF = 13,987.2 SF**

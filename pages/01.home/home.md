OLD TURNS NEW

NEW TURNS TIMELESS

===

The architectural firm engages in full architectural service. The name, LEAF ARCHITECTURE, is an outgrowth of new beginnings. 


The Ginkgo tree (LEAF) is a phenomenon, an object of veneration, a sacred tree of the East, a symbol of unity of opposites, by some seen as a symbol of changelessness, possessing miraculous power, bearer of hope and of the immeasurable past, a symbol of love. Because of all its properties it is associated with longevity.
